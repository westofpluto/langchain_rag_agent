The ancient library stood at the edge of town, its weathered stone walls covered in ivy. Inside, thousands of books lined the shelves from floor to ceiling. Dust particles danced in the streams of sunlight that filtered through tall, narrow windows. The head librarian, Mrs. Chen, had worked there for forty years and knew the location of every single volume by heart. She often said the library had a soul of its own, whispering stories to those who listened carefully. Students came to study, researchers to discover, and dreamers to escape into other worlds between the pages.
