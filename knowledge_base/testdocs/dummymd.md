# Recipe: Grandmother's Apple Pie

This recipe has been passed down through three generations. The secret ingredient is a dash of cinnamon mixed with a hint of nutmeg. Start by peeling six large Granny Smith apples and slicing them thinly. Mix the apples with half a cup of sugar, two tablespoons of flour, and your spices. Roll out your pie dough carefully - it should be thin but not transparent. Fill the bottom crust, dot with butter, and cover with the top crust. Seal the edges by crimping with a fork. Bake at 375 degrees for fifty minutes until golden brown and bubbling.
